# 🧪 Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Titanic Dataset

## 📌 Objective
To explore and understand the dataset using visualizations and summary statistics. This helps uncover hidden patterns, detect outliers, and form hypotheses for predictive modeling.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly

## 📁 Dataset
*Titanic Dataset*  
[Download Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/master/titanic.csv)

---

## 🔍 Steps Performed

1. *Summary Statistics*
   - Mean, Median, Standard Deviation, Count for each feature

2. *Visualizations*
   - Histogram and KDE plot for Age
   - Boxplot for Fare across Passenger Classes
   - Correlation Matrix and Pairplot
   - Distribution of Age by Gender using Plotly Boxplot
   - Fare Distribution using Histogram

3. *Feature-Level Inferences*
   - Survival rate by gender
   - Age distribution with respect to survival

---

## 📈 Insights
- Females had a higher survival rate than males.
- Passengers in higher classes paid more fare.
- Strong correlation between class and fare.
- Skewed fare distribution with many outliers.
